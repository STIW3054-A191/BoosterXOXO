# Introduction
This is a real-time system which are developed by using Java programming language (Maven). The system will do the following:-

1. Get a list of repositories from the link : https://github.com/STIW3054-A191/Assignments/issues/1
2. Download all the repositories from the list to the computer/laptop using Java threads.
3. Compile the Java program for each repository. If the Java program cannot be compiled, error messages will be send to a log file.
4. Run the program and store the output in a text file.
5. Generate software metrics using CKJM (https://www.spinellis.gr/sw/ckjm/) for each Java program and store the result in a text file.
6. Store the accumulative metrics for all the Java programs in MS Excel.
7. Generate a bar graph for each metric from the excel file and store all the graphs in a pdf file.
8. Calculate the execution time.
